**Description: Hide player blips and overhead player names!**

### Features
#### Overhead Player Names
- Hide overhead names of all players.
- (Optional) enable overhead names if you are within x meters from another player.
- (Optional) enable overhead names if there are less than x amount of players online.
- (Optional) God permissions override this and you will still be able to see the overhead names, no matter what.
#### Player Blips
- Hide player blips on the minimap (radar) and/or the main map in the pause menu.
- (Optional) Only hide player blips when there are more than x amount of players online.
- (Optional) Don't hide the player blips from minimap and/or the main map if the player has the god permission.
- (Experimental) You have an option to disable PLD generated blips. However this is still a bit buggy and if you enable this option, it will disable Player Blips on the main map and on the minimap, for both regular player **AND** players with the God permission. Regardless of any other settings. There's nothing I can do about this, it's caused by the way PLD is coded.
